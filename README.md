# Strimzi Sandbox

The Strimzi Sandbox is a service for trying out Strimzi and showing how it works. It is geared
towards the use case of granting secure, temporary access to an instance of Kafka using Strimzi.

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

If you want to learn more about Quarkus, please visit its website: https://quarkus.io/ .

The service is currently hosted at https://kafka.lulf.no
